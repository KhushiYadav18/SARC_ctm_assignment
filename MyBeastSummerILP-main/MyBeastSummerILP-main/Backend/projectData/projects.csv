artificial intelligence software that uses generative AI to analyze images of grapevines and fruit to predict yield as well as identify diseases and other things that might impact yield.
Agronomists perform regular audits of vineyards and routinely take pictures of vines and fruits to then estimate yield per acre and if there are any diseases that might impact yield. This information is valuable for the grower to estimate potential revenue at the end of the season and understand how they can improve yield.
The Phase-1 objectives and deliverables of this program are to create the software and models to identify diseases by analyzing an uploaded image. The initial training dataset needs to be collected from government / USDA / NIH data sources and train the model.
Phase-2 objective is to count the fruit and estimate yield per acre.

various industries. Segregation during flow due to difference in size, shape and density is
very common. Depending on the size of the orifice, materials also clogged during flow
which affects the overall flow of the particles. In this project, focus is on to study flow,
segregation and clogging of non-spherical grains during discharge in three dimensional
silos through orifice. The flow rate will be measured for various parameters such as orifice
diameter (D), mass fraction of small and large particles (χ), and shape of particles (e.g.rice and moong daal). In the past, researchers observed that when small particles (fine) added  into the mixture of large particles flow rate is increased and clogging is also reduced. Segregation during discharge can also be measured by calculating amount of small and large particles at the start of the experiments and in the end by collecting sample of mixture. We can also measured clogging point (χ clog) for different orifice.
